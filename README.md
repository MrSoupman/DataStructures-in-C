This repository is a bunch of projects from Rutgers University's CS112 course, Data Structures. The difference is it has been rewritten in C.
The purpose of this was more to help me review my data structures and what I fundamentally understand, while challenging myself to work in a language that I'm fairly weak with.
Each project is compiled on Ubuntu 21.04.
If you are a cs112 student and you copy and paste this to try and pass cs112 you will fail on account of this being in C :^)
